# Android Logcat without Root

Read Android logs without root access. The app uses remote debugging to connect to phone local ADB daemon. Configuring remote debugging on a phone can be challenging and requires some technical expertise. It has to be done once and after each device reboot.

Enable USB debugging first on your device. Navigate to Settings > About Phone and tap Build number seven times. Go back, access the Developer options menu and check USB debugging option.

Next step is to enable remote debugging. You need to have Android SDK installed on your computer. Connect your phone via USB cable and run following adb command:

```
adb tcpip 5555


```

Disconnect USB cable before trying to use the app. Some phones have problems handling network ADB connection when they are connected via USB as well.

Sometimes establishing connection to ADB hangs and requires killing and restarting the app. It seems to be a problem with ADB daemon itself and not the app issue.
